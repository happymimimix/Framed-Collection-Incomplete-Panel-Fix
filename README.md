# Framed Collection Incomplete Panel Fix
This is an unofficial fix for the incomplete panel video in Framed Collection. 

The cutscene at where the girl fall down from the tower has been cut in Framed Collection. 

This is the incomplete video from Framed Collection: 
[Panel_03.webm](https://github.com/happymimimix/Framed-Collection-Incomplete-Panel-Fix/assets/107282563/0eb932b1-975d-4101-841b-e43c6e4cac69)

This is the full video from the original IOS version: 
[Panel_03.mp4](https://github.com/happymimimix/Framed-Collection-Incomplete-Panel-Fix/assets/107282563/163cbb6f-3231-4bd3-9b33-bebf6393fd0a)

I have no idea why they did that, it make completely no sense! 

Thankfully, the resources arn't encrypted in framed collection, which means we can just simply replace that incomplete video with the full version from IOS and the problem is solved! 

This repo contains the .webm format video I converted from the .mp4 file I found in Framed 2's ipa file. 

Have fun!
